The Call Centre Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key performance metrics and operational insights, enabling effective management and decision-making. The dashboard is designed to offer a user-friendly interface with interactive visuals that allow for in-depth analysis of call centre activities. Key features of the dashboard include:

1. Call Volume Analysis:
Displays total incoming and outgoing calls over time.
Breaks down call volumes by day, week, and month, helping to identify peak times and trends.

2. Average Handling Time (AHT):
Visualizes the average time agents spend on calls.
Enables comparison of AHT across different teams and shifts, identifying areas for efficiency improvement.

3. Agent Performance Tracking:
Provides individual agent metrics such as number of calls handled, average handling time, and customer satisfaction scores.
Highlights top-performing agents and those who may need additional training.

4. Call Resolution Metrics:
Tracks first call resolution rates, showing the percentage of calls resolved without the need for follow-ups.
Identifies common issues that may require escalation or additional resources.

5. Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) Scores:
Displays overall customer satisfaction ratings derived from post-call surveys.
Analyzes satisfaction scores by different factors such as call type, agent, and time of day.
Tracks the percentage of calls answered within the SLA timeframe.
Monitors compliance trends over time and across different departments.

The dashboard is designed to be dynamic, allowing users to filter data by various dimensions such as date range, agent, and call type. This interactivity helps managers quickly identify issues and take data-driven actions to improve overall call centre performance.
