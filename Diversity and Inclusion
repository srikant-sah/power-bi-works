In this project, I created a Diversity & Inclusion Dashboard using Power BI, aimed at providing a comprehensive analysis of workforce diversity within an organization. The dashboard visualizes key metrics related to gender distribution, hiring, promotions, turnover rates, and performance ratings, offering insights into the organization's efforts toward achieving diversity and inclusion goals.

Key features of the dashboard include:

1. Gender Distribution: Tracks the gender balance across various job levels, from executive to junior officer, highlighting areas where gender diversity is strong or needs improvement.

2. Hiring and Promotion Analysis: Displays the percentage of female hires and promotees, offering insights into the effectiveness of the organization's diversity initiatives at different career stages.

3. Turnover Rates: Analyzes turnover rates by gender and job level, helping to identify trends and potential areas of concern regarding employee retention.
4. Performance Ratings: Compares the performance ratings of employees who have left the organization versus those who have stayed, segmented by gender, to assess any disparities.

This project showcases my ability to leverage Power BI to create an interactive and data-driven tool that helps organizations monitor and improve their diversity and inclusion efforts.
